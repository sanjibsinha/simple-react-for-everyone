# simple-react-for-everyone

Act as a senior React developer and please teach me React framework considering I am a layman who wants to start learning React Framework from scratch. 
However, I want to learn all the key concepts that will help me to build my personal projects with your guidabce.
These projects should not be very complex but could range from small to medium size as long as complexity is concerned. 
Moreover, I would like you to move your lessons from less complex to medium to advanced concepts by creating a React app so that I can learn to implement my knowledge instantly. 
The whole lesson could be big, that is not an issue but I would like you to cover everything that is available in React documentation, if there is any.
So today teach me the following concepts with examples and explanations.
